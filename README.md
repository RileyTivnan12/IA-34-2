# IA 340 Code

Welcome to my IA340 repository for lab assignments and projects. 

This is my [IA340](https://catalog.jmu.edu/preview_course_nopop.php?catoid=50&coid=258336) course code.

*Data mining* is the nontrivial extraction of previously unknown and potential useful information from (large) data sets to help explain current behaviors and anticipate future outcomes. Students will apply data mining and knowledge discovery methods to data sets from business, industry and government. The course is team oriented, project based and grounded in the relevant legal and ethical context.

## Purpose

This repository contains code, notebooks, and data related to coursework in **IA 340: Data Mining, Modeling, and Knowledge Discovery in Databases** at James Madison University. The goal is to determine data analytics skills using Python, SQL, AWS, and AI tools.
